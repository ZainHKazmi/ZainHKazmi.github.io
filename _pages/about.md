I am a Software Engineer and aspiring Solutions Architect highly-skilled in Full-Stack development, Machine Learning and Systems Programming with a Computer Science and Mathematics background from the University of Toronto.

My breadth of experience ranges from high-profiting startups to large government organizations. Tools I developed have saved organizations millions of dollars $$$ as well as have increased task efficiency up-to 1000%. I also have had the opportunity to work alongside and learn from some of the most accomplished individuals in their respective fields. My skills as a leader and a software developer are something I try to refine at every opportunity and I also do my best to help others along the way.

In addition to my full-time role, I spend time advising and consulting for growing teams and startups on a plethora of technological endeavors including full-stack web development, systems integrations and migrations, GUI development and software engineering best practices.
